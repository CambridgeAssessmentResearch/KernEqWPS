Title: Kernel Equating Without Pre-Smoothing
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Tom", "Benton", email = "benton.t@cambridgeassessment.org.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package is designed to make kernel equating much easier
    than at present by removing the manual task of pre-smoothing the data. This
    is replaced by methods that achieve smoothing through choosing an appropriate
    bandwidth.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0)
Imports: MASS
