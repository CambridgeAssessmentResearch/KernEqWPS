\title{Apply Levine Observed Score equating to data from a NEAT design.}
\usage{
LevineObservedEquate(dx, dy, ws = NA, internal = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dx}{Data frame with variables "x" and "a" representing scores for individual candidates on form X and on the anchor test.}

\item{dy}{Data frame with variables "y" and "a" representing scores for individual candidates on form Y and on the anchor test.}

\item{ws}{Vector of two elements denoting the relative weights of the dx population and the dy population in the synthetic population where equating takes place.}

\item{internal}{Logical input denoting whether the anchor test in internal or external (default) to the tests being equated.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{lys}{A function that translates any vector of scores on form X into equivalent scores on form Y.}
  \item{EqTable}{A data frame combining the sorted unique scores on form X in the data and their equated values on form Y.}
  \item{muSx}{Estimated mean on form X within the synthetic population.}
  \item{sigmaSx}{Estimated standard deviation on form X within the synthetic population.}
  \item{muSy}{Estimated mean on form Y within the synthetic population.}
  \item{sigmaSy}{Estimated standard deviation on form Y within the synthetic population.}
}
