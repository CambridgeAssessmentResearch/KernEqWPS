\format{An object of class \code{list} of length 5.}
\usage{
ApproxCNNWeights
}
\description{
This list forms the basis of the \emph{PredPercentileCNN} and \emph{EquateCNN} functions. It is mainly supplied to satisfy any 
curiosity about the way in which these functions work.
The weights and biases in this list are unlikely to be of real interest outside of the functions that 
utilise them.
