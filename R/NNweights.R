#' A list of weights and biases for experimental equating using neural networks
#'
#' This list forms the basis of the \emph{PredPercentileNN} and \emph{EquateNN} functions. It is mainly supplied to satisfy any 
#' curiosity about the way in which these functions work.
#' The weights and biases in this list are unlikely to be of real interest outside of the functions that 
#' utilise them.
